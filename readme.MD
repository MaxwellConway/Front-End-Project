## Function

This repo includes four (4) HTML documents that can be opened in a browser. The primary HTML document (index.html) functions as a "home page." This page displays three (3) main categories to select from (weapons, sorceries, or incantations). Clicking on one of these options will take you to a new page that displays all of the available items from the video game that fit the selected category. On this new page, there are buttons that allow you to further filter the displayed elements.

## Style

All of the style for this project is included in the style.css file. This file includes styling for elements on each html document. Visually, there is a dark theme, focused on dark-grey backgrounds with white text. All images have been set to 200x200px in the javascript and reside within containers that are themselves styled in the CSS. These containers can be identified by their thin outline on the page.

## API

This project uses data from a fanmade API. This data is from the video game Elden Ring. I used this data to display different weapons, sorceries and incantations on the page in a thumbnail format. These thumbnails can be clicked and are each linked to a corresponding wiki page. These elements can also be filtered using buttons at the top of each page.
